    Definition and Usage
The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed.

Default value:	normal
Inherited:	yes
Animatable:	yes. Read about animatable
Version:	CSS1
JavaScript syntax:	object.style.fontWeight="bold"
CSS Syntax
font-weight: normal|bold|bolder|lighter|number|initial|inherit;
Property Values
Value	Description	Play it
normal	Defines normal characters. This is default	
bold	Defines thick characters	
bolder	Defines thicker characters	
lighter	Defines lighter characters	
100
200
300
400
500
600
700
800
900	Defines from thin to thick characters. 400 is the same as normal, and 700 is the same as bold	
initial	Sets this property to its default value. Read about initial	
inherit	Inherits this property from its parent element. Read about inherit	
*********MDN***********
The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the font-family that is currently set.

Syntax
/* Keyword values */
font-weight: normal;
font-weight: bold;

/* Keyword values relative to the parent */
font-weight: lighter;
font-weight: bolder;

/* Numeric keyword values */
font-weight: 100;
font-weight: 200;
font-weight: 300;
font-weight: 400;// normal
font-weight: 500;
font-weight: 600;
font-weight: 700;// bold
font-weight: 800;
font-weight: 900;

/* Global values */
font-weight: inherit;
font-weight: initial;
font-weight: unset;
The font-weight property is specified using any one of the values listed below.

Values
normal
Normal font weight. Same as 400.
bold
Bold font weight. Same as 700.
lighter
One relative font weight lighter than the parent element. Note that only four font weights are considered for relative weight calculation; see the Meaning of relative weights section below.
bolder
One relative font weight heavier than the parent element. Note that only four font weights are considered for relative weight calculation; see the Meaning of relative weights section below.
<number>
A <number> value between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Higher numbers represent weights that are bolder than (or as bold as) lower numbers. Certain commonly used values correspond to common weight names, as described in the Common weight name mapping section below.
In earlier versions of the font-weight specification, the property accepts only keyword values and the numeric values 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900; non-variable fonts can only really make use of these set values, although fine-grained values (e.g. 451) will be translated to one of these values for non-variable fonts using the Fallback weights system.

CSS Fonts Level 4 extends the syntax to accept any number between 1 and 1000 and introduces Variable fonts, which can make use of this much finer-grained range of font weights.

Fallback weights
If the exact weight given is unavailable, then the following rule is used to determine the weight actually rendered:

If the target weight given is between 400 and 500 inclusive:
Look for available weights between the target and 500, in ascending order.
If no match is found, look for available weights less than the target, in descending order.
If no match is found, look for available weights greater than 500, in ascending order.
If a weight less than 400 is given, look for available weights less than the target, in descending order. If no match is found, look for available weights greater than the target, in ascending order.
If a weight greater than 500 is given, look for available weights greater than the target, in ascending order. If no match is found, look for available weights less than the target, in descending order.
Meaning of relative weights
When lighter or bolder is specified, the below chart shows how the absolute font weight of the element is determined.

Note that when using relative weights, only four font weights are considered â€” thin (100), normal (400), bold (700), and heavy (900). If a font-family has more weights available, they are ignored for the purposes of relative weight calculation.

Inherited value	bolder	lighter
100	400	100
200	400	100
300	400	100
400	700	100
500	700	100
600	900	400
700	900	400
800	900	700
900	900	700
Common weight name mapping
The numerical values 100 to 900 roughly correspond to the following common weight names (see the OpenType specification):

Value	Common weight name
100	Thin (Hairline)
200	Extra Light (Ultra Light)
300	Light
400	Normal (Regular)
500	Medium
600	Semi Bold (Demi Bold)
700	Bold
800	Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)
900	Black (Heavy)
950	Extra Black (Ultra Black)
Variable fonts
Most fonts have a particular weight which corresponds to one of the numbers in Common weight name mapping. However some fonts, called variable fonts, can support a range of weights with a more or less fine granularity, and this can give the designer a much closer degree of control over the chosen weight.

For TrueType or OpenType variable fonts, the "wght" variation is used to implement varying widths.

For the example below to work, you'll need a browser that supports the CSS Fonts Level 4 syntax in which font-weight can be any number between 1 and 1000.
Accessibility concerns
People experiencing low vision conditions may have difficulty reading text set with a font-weight value of 100 (Thin/Hairline) or 200 (Extra Light), especially if the font has a low contrast color ratio.
