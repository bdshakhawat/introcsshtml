<!-- 
    Definition and Usage
The font-stretch property allows you to make text narrower (condensed) or wider (expanded).

Note: Some fonts provide additional faces; condensed faces and expanded faces. For these fonts, you can use the font-stretch property to selct a normal, condensed, or expanded font face.

Note: This property has no effect if the selected font does not offer condensed or expanded faces!

Default value:	normal
Inherited:	yes
Animatable:	yes. Read about animatable
Version:	CSS3
JavaScript syntax:	object.style.fontStretch="expanded"
Syntax
font-stretch: ultra-condensed|extra-condensed|condensed|semi-condensed|normal|semi-expanded|expanded|extra-expanded|ultra-expanded|initial|inherit;
Property Values
Value	Description
ultra-condensed	Makes the text as narrow as it gets
extra-condensed	Makes the text narrower than condensed, but not as narrow as ultra-condensed
condensed	Makes the text narrower than semi-condensed, but not as narrow as extra-condensed
semi-condensed	Makes the text narrower than normal, but not as narrow as condensed
normal	Default value. No font stretching
semi-expanded	Makes the text wider than normal, but not as wide as expanded
expanded	Makes the text wider than semi-expanded, but not as wide as extra-expanded
extra-expanded	Makes the text wider than expanded, but not as wide as ultra-expanded
ultra-expanded	Makes the text as wide as it gets
initial	Sets this property to its default value. Read about initial
inherit	Inherits this property from its parent element. Read about inherit
**********MDN*********************
The font-stretch CSS property selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font.

/* Keyword values */
font-stretch: ultra-condensed;
font-stretch: extra-condensed;
font-stretch: condensed;
font-stretch: semi-condensed;
font-stretch: normal;
font-stretch: semi-expanded;
font-stretch: expanded;
font-stretch: extra-expanded;
font-stretch: ultra-expanded;

/* Percentage values */
font-stretch: 50%;
font-stretch: 100%;
font-stretch: 200%;

/* Global values */
font-stretch: inherit;
font-stretch: initial;
font-stretch: unset;
Syntax
This property may be specified as a single keyword value or a single <percentage> value.

Values
normal
Specifies a normal font face.
semi-condensed, condensed, extra-condensed, ultra-condensed
Specifies a more condensed font face than normal, with ultra-condensed as the most condensed.
semi-expanded, expanded, extra-expanded, ultra-expanded
Specifies a more expanded font face than normal, with ultra-expanded as the most expanded.
<percentage>
A <percentage> value between 50% and 200% (inclusive). Negative values are not allowed for this property.

In earlier versions of the font-stretch specification, the property accepts only the nine keyword values.

The CSS Fonts Module Level 4 spec extends the syntax to accept a <percentage> value as well. This enables variable fonts to offer something more like a continuum of character widths. For TrueType or OpenType variable fonts, the "wdth" variation is used to implement varying widths.

However, note that the <percentage> syntax is not yet supported by all browsers: check the Browser compatibility table for details.

Keyword to numeric mapping
The table below shows the mapping between keyword values and numeric percentages:

Keyword	Percentage
ultra-condensed	50%
extra-condensed	62.5%
condensed	75%
semi-condensed	87.5%
normal	100%
semi-expanded	112.5%
expanded	125%
extra-expanded	150%
ultra-expanded	200%
Description
Some font families offer additional faces in which the characters are narrower than the normal face (condensed faces) or wider than the normal face (expanded faces).

You can use font-stretch to select a condensed or expanded face from such fonts. If the font you are using does not offer condensed or expanded faces, this property has no effect.

Font face selection
The face selected for a given value of font-stretch depends on the faces supported by the font in question. If the font does not provide a face that exactly matches the given value, then values less than 100% map to a narrower face, and values greater than or equal to 100% map to a wider face.

The table below demonstrates the effect of supplying various different percentage values of font-stretch on two different fonts:

50%	62.5%	75%	87.5%	100%	112.5%	125%	150%	200%
Helvetica Neue									
League Mono Variable									
Helvetica Neue, which is installed by default on macOS, has a single condensed face in addition to the normal face. All values of font-stretch less than 100% select the condensed face, while all other values select the normal face.
League Mono Variable is a variable font that offers something like a continuous range of widths for different percentage values of font-stretch.
Formal definition
Initial value	normal
Applies to	all elements. It also applies to ::first-letter and ::first-line.
Inherited	yes
Computed value	as specified
Animation type	a font stretch
Formal syntax
<font-stretch-absolute>where <font-stretch-absolute> = normal | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed | semi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded | ultra-expanded | <percentage>
Examples
Setting font stretch percentages
Note: This example will only work in browsers that support <percentage> values.

    <p class="condensed">an elephantine lizard</p>

Specifications
Specification	Status	Comment
