    The CSS @font-face Rule
Web fonts allow Web designers to use fonts that are not installed on the user's computer.

When you have found/bought the font you wish to use, just include the font file on your web server, and it will be automatically downloaded to the user when needed.

Your "own" fonts are defined within the CSS @font-face rule.

Different Font Formats
TrueType Fonts (TTF)

TrueType is a font standard developed in the late 1980s, by Apple and Microsoft. TrueType is the most common font format for both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

OpenType Fonts (OTF)

OpenType is a format for scalable computer fonts. It was built on TrueType, and is a registered trademark of Microsoft. OpenType fonts are used commonly today on the major computer platforms.

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF)

WOFF is a font format for use in web pages. It was developed in 2009, and is now a W3C Recommendation. WOFF is essentially OpenType or TrueType with compression and additional metadata. The goal is to support font distribution from a server to a client over a network with bandwidth constraints.

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF 2.0)

TrueType/OpenType font that provides better compression than WOFF 1.0.

SVG Fonts/Shapes

SVG fonts allow SVG to be used as glyphs when displaying text. The SVG 1.1 specification define a font module that allows the creation of fonts within an SVG document. You can also apply CSS to SVG documents, and the @font-face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents.

Embedded OpenType Fonts (EOT)

EOT fonts are a compact form of OpenType fonts designed by Microsoft for use as embedded fonts on web pages.

Using The Font You Want
In the @font-face rule; first define a name for the font (e.g. myFirstFont) and then point to the font file.

Tip: Always use lowercase letters for the font URL. Uppercase letters can give unexpected results in IE.

To use the font for an HTML element, refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the font-family property:
CSS Font Descriptors
The following table lists all the font descriptors that can be defined inside the @font-face rule:

CSS @font-face Rule👪 
Definition and Usage
With the @font-face rule, web designers do not have to use one of the "web-safe" fonts anymore.

In the @font-face rule you must first define a name for the font (e.g. myFirstFont), and then point to the font file.

To use the font for an HTML element, refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the font-family property:

div {

  font-family: myFirstFont;
}
Browser Support
The @font-face rule is supported in Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.

Syntax
@font-face {
  font-properties

**********Css Tricks************
The @font-face rule allows custom fonts to be loaded on a webpage. Once added to a stylesheet, the rule instructs the browser to download the font from where it is hosted, then display it as specified in the CSS.

Without the rule, our designs are limited to the fonts that are already loaded on a user’s computer, which vary depending on the system being used. Here’s a nice breakdown of existing system fonts.

Deepest Possible Browser Support
This is the method with the deepest support possible right now. The @font-face rule should be added to the stylesheet before any styles.

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('webfont.eot'); /* IE9 Compat Modes */
  src: url('webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('webfont.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Super Modern Browsers */
       url('webfont.woff') format('woff'), /* Pretty Modern Browsers */
       url('webfont.ttf')  format('truetype'), /* Safari, Android, iOS */
       url('webfont.svg#svgFontName') format('svg'); /* Legacy iOS */
}
Then use it to style elements like this:

body {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont', Fallback, sans-serif;
}
Practical Level of Browser Support
Things are shifting heavily toward WOFF and WOFF 2, so we can probably get away with:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src:  url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
        url('myfont.woff') format('woff');
}
Slightly Deeper Browser Support
If you need a sort of a happy medium between full support and practical support, this will cover a few more bases:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('myfont.woff') format('woff'),
       url('myfont.ttf') format('truetype');
}
Super Progressive Browser Support
If we’re staking the farm on WOFF, then we can expect things to shift toward WOFF2 at some point in time. That means we can live on the bleeding edge with:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2');
}
Alternative Techniques
@import
While @font-face is excellent for fonts that are hosted on our own servers, there may be situations where a hosted font solution is better. Google Fonts offers this as a way to use their fonts. The following is an example of using @import to load the Open Sans font from Google Fonts:

@import url(//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans);
Then we can use it to style elements:

body {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
If you open the URL for the font, you can actually see all the @font-face work being done behind the scenes.

A benefit of using a hosted service is that it is likely to include all the font file variations, which ensures deep cross-browser compatibility without having to host all those files ourselves.


<link>ing a stylesheet
Similarly, you could link to the same asset as you would any other CSS file, in the of the HTML document rather than in the CSS. Using the same example from Google Fonts, this is what we would use:

Then, we can style our elements like the other methods:

body {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
Again, this is importing the @font-face rules but, instead of injecting them to our stylesheet, they are added to our HTML instead.
Understanding Font File Types
The original snippet at the top of this post references a lot of files with strange extensions. Let’s go over each one and get a better understanding of what they mean.

WOFF / WOFF2
Stands for: Web Open Font Format.

Created for use on the web, and developed by Mozilla in conjunction with other organizations, WOFF fonts often load faster than other formats because they use a compressed version of the structure used by OpenType (OTF) and TrueType (TTF) fonts. This format can also include metadata and license info within the font file. This format seems to be the winner and where all browsers are headed.

WOFF2 is the next generation of WOFF and boasts better compression than the original.

SVG / SVGZ
Stands for: Scalable Vector Graphics (Font)

SVG is a vector re-creation of the font, which makes it much lighter in file size, and also makes it ideal for mobile use. This format is the only one allowed by version 4.1 and below of Safari for iOS. SVG fonts are not currently supported by Firefox, IE or IE Mobile. Firefox has postponed implementation indefinitely to focus on WOFF.

SVGZ is the zipped version of SVG.

EOT
Stands for: Embedded Open Type.

This format was created by Microsoft (the original innovators of @font-face) and is a proprietary file standard supported only by IE. In fact, it’s the only format that IE8 and below will recognize when using @font-face.

OTF / TTF
Stands for: OpenType Font and TrueType Font.

The WOFF format was initially created as a reaction to OTF and TTF, in part, because these formats could easily (and illegally) be copied, However, OpenType has capabilities that many designers might be interested in (ligatures and such).

A Note on Performance
Web fonts are great for design but it’s important to also understand their impact on web performance. Custom fonts often cause sites to take a performance hit because the font must be downloaded before it’s displayed.

A common symptom used to be a brief moment where fonts first load as the fallback, then blink to the downloaded font. Paul Irish has an older post on this (dubbed “FOUT”: Flash Of Unstyled Text).

These days, browsers are generally hiding the text before the custom font loads by default. Better or worse? You decide. You can exert some control over this through various techniques. A little out-of-scope for this article, but here’s a trifecta of articles by Zach Leatherman to get you started down the rabbit hole:

Better @font-face with Font Load Events
How we use web fonts responsibly, or, avoiding a @font-face-palm
Flash of Faux Text—still more on Font Loading
Here are some more considerations when implementing custom fonts:

Watch the file size
Fonts can be surprisingly heavy, so lean towards options that offer lighter versions. For example, favor a font set that is 50KB versus one that weighs 400KB.

Limit the character set, if possible
Do you really need the bold and black weights for one font? Limiting your font sets to load only what is used is a good idea and there are some good tips on that here.

Consider system fonts for small screens
Many devices are stuck on crappy connections. One trick might be to target larger screens when loading the custom font using @media.

In this example, screens smaller than 1000px will be served a system font instead and screens that wide and above will be served the custom font.

@media (min-width: 1000px) { 
  body {
    font-family: 'FontName', Fallback, sans-serif; 
  }
}
Font Services
There are a number of services that will host fonts and provide access to commercially-licensed fonts as well. The benefits of using a service often boil down to having a large selection of legal fonts delivered efficiently (e.g. serving them on a speedy CDN).

Here are a few hosted font services:

Cloud Typography
Typekit
Fontdeck
Webtype
Fontspring
Typotheque
Fonts.com
Google Fonts
Font Squirrel
What About Icon Fonts?
It’s true, @font-face can load a font file full of icons that can be used for an icon system. However, I think you’re far better off using SVG as an icon system. Here’s a comparison of the two methods.

CSS Font Families
********MDN**************
n the first article of the module, we explored the basic CSS features available for styling fonts and text. In this article we will go further, exploring web fonts in detail — these allow you to download custom fonts along with your web page, to allow for more varied, custom text styling.

Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML), CSS basics (study Introduction to CSS), CSS text and font fundamentals.
Objective:	To learn how to apply web fonts to a web page, using either a third party service, or by writing your own code.
Font families recap
As we looked at in Fundamental text and font styling, the fonts applied to your HTML can be controlled using the font-family property. This takes one or more font family names, and the browser travels down the list until it finds a font it has available on the system it is running on:

p {
  font-family: Helvetica, "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;
}
This system works well, but traditionally web developers' font choices were limited. There are only a handful of fonts that you can guarantee to be available across all common systems — the so-called Web-safe fonts. You can use the font stack to specify preferable fonts, followed by web-safe alternatives, followed by the default system font, but this adds overhead in terms of testing to make sure that your designs look ok with each font, etc.

Web fonts
But there is an alternative, which works very well, right back to IE version 6. Web fonts are a CSS feature that allows you to specify font files to be downloaded along with your website as it is accessed, meaning that any browser that supports web fonts can have exactly the fonts you specify available to it. Amazing! The syntax required looks something like this:

First of all, you have a @font-face block at the start of the CSS, which specifies the font file(s) to download:

@font-face {
  font-family: "myFont";
  src: url("myFont.woff");
}
Below this you can then use the font family name specified inside @font-face to apply your custom font to anything you like, as normal:

html {
  font-family: "myFont", "Bitstream Vera Serif", serif;
}
The syntax does get a bit more complex than this; we'll go into more detail below.

There are two important things to bear in mind about web fonts:

Browsers support different font formats, so you'll need multiple font formats for decent cross-browser support. For example, most modern browsers support WOFF/WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format versions 1 and 2), the most efficient format around, but older versions of IE only support EOT (Embedded Open Type) fonts, and you might need to include an SVG version of the font to support older versions of iPhone and Android browsers. We'll show you below how to generate the required code.
Fonts generally aren't free to use. You have to pay for them, and/or follow other license conditions such as crediting the font creator in the code (or on your site). You shouldn't steal fonts and use them without giving proper credit.
Note: Web fonts as a technology have been supported in Internet Explorer since version 4!

You can use the Firefox Font Editor to investigate and manipulate the fonts in use on your page, whether they are web fonts or not. This video provides a nice walkthrough:



Active learning: A web font example
With this in mind, let's build up a basic web font example from first principles. It is difficult to demonstrate this using an embedded live example, so instead, we would like you to follow the steps detailed in the below sections, to get an idea of the process.

You should use the web-font-start.html and web-font-start.css files as a starting point to add your code to (see the live example). Make a copy of these files in a new directory on your computer now. In the web-font-start.css file, you'll find some minimal CSS to deal with the basic layout and typesetting of the example.

Finding fonts
For this example, we'll use two web fonts, one for the headings, and one for the body text. To start with, we need to find the font files that contain the fonts. Fonts are created by font foundries and are stored in different file formats. There are generally three types of sites where you can obtain fonts:

A free font distributor: This is a site that makes free fonts available for download (there may still be some license conditions, such as crediting the font creator). Examples include Font Squirrel, dafont, and Everything Fonts.
A paid font distributor: This is a site that makes fonts available for a charge, such as fonts.com or myfonts.com. You can also buy fonts directly from font foundries, for example Linotype, Monotype, or Exljbris.
An online font service: This is a site that stores and serves the fonts for you, making the whole process easier. See the Using an online font service section for more details.
Let's find some fonts! Go to Font Squirrel and choose two fonts — a nice interesting font for the headings (maybe a nice display or slab serif font), and slightly less flashy and more readable font for the paragraphs. When you find each font, press on the download button, and save the file inside the same directory as the HTML and CSS files you saved earlier. It doesn't matter whether they are TTF (True Type Fonts) or OTF (Open Type Fonts).

In each case, unzip the font package (Web fonts are usually distributed in ZIP files containing the font file(s) and licensing information). You may find multiple font files in the package — some fonts are distributed as a family with different variants available, for example thin, medium, bold, italic, thin italic, etc. For this example, we just want you to concern yourself with a single font file for each choice.

Note: Under the "Find fonts" section in the right-hand column, you can click on the different tags and classifications to filter the displayed choices.

Generating the required code
Now you'll need to generate the required code (and font formats). For each font, follow these steps:

Make sure you have satisfied any licensing requirement, if you are going to use this in a commercial and/or Web project.
Go to the Fontsquirrel Webfont Generator.
Upload your two font files using the Upload Fonts button.
Check the checkbox labeled "Yes, the fonts I'm uploading are legally eligible for web embedding."
Click Download your kit.
After the generator has finished processing, you should get a ZIP file to download — save it in the same directory as your HTML and CSS.

Web services for font generation typically limit file sizes. In such a case, consider using tools such as:

sfnt2woff-zopfli for converting ttf to woff
fontforge for converting from ttf to svg
batik ttf2svffor converting from ttf to svg
woff2for converting from ttf to woff2
Implementing the code in your demo
At this point, unzip the webfont kit you just generated. Inside the unzipped directory you'll see three useful items:

Multiple versions of each font: (for example .ttf, .woff, .woff2, etc.; the exact fonts provided will be updated over time as browser support requirements change). As mentioned above, multiple fonts are needed for cross browser support — this is Fontsquirrel's way of making sure you've got everything you need.
A demo HTML file for each font — load these in your browser to see what the font will look like in different usage contexts.
A stylesheet.css file, which contains the generated @font-face code you'll need.
To implement these fonts in your demo, follow these steps:

Rename the unzipped directory to something easy and simple, like fonts.
Open up the stylesheet.css file and copy both the @font-face blocks contained inside into your web-font-start.css file — you need to put them at the very top, before any of your CSS, as the fonts need to be imported before you can use them on your site.
Each of the url() functions points to a font file that we want to import into our CSS — we need to make sure the paths to the files are correct, so add fonts/ to the start of each path (adjust as necessary).
Now you can use these fonts in your font stacks, just like any web safe or default system font. For example:
font-family: 'zantrokeregular', serif;
You should end up with a demo page with some nice fonts implemented on them. Because different fonts are created at different sizes, you may have to adjust the size, spacing, etc., to sort out the look and feel.



Note: If you have any problems getting this to work, feel free to compare your version to our finished files — see web-font-finished.html and web-font-finished.css (run the finished example live).

Using an online font service
Online font services generally store and serve fonts for you, so you don't have to worry about writing the @font-face code, and generally just need to insert a simple line or two of code into your site to make everything work. Examples include Adobe Fonts and Cloud.typography. Most of these services are subscription-based, with the notable exception of Google Fonts, a useful free service, especially for rapid testing work and writing demos.

Most of these services are easy to use, so we won't cover them in great detail. Let's have a quick look at Google fonts, so you can get the idea. Again, use copies of web-font-start.html and web-font-start.css as your starting point.

Go to Google Fonts.
Use the filters on the left-hand side to display the kinds of fonts you want to choose and choose a couple of fonts you like.
To select a font family, press the ⊕ button alongside it.
When you've chosen the font families, press the [Number] Families Selected bar at the bottom of the page.
In the resulting screen, you first need to copy the line of HTML code shown and paste it into the head of your HTML file. Put it above the existing <link> element, so that the font is imported before you try to use it in your CSS.
You then need to copy the CSS declarations listed into your CSS as appropriate, to apply the custom fonts to your HTML.
Note: You can find a completed version at google-font.html and google-font.css, if you need to check your work against ours (see it live).

@font-face in more detail
Let's explore that @font-face syntax generated for you by fontsquirrel. This is what one of the blocks looks like:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'ciclefina';
  src: url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.eot');
  src: url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.svg#ciclefina') format('svg');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
This is referred to as "bulletproof @font-face syntax", after a post by Paul Irish from early on when @font-face started to get popular (Bulletproof @font-face Syntax). Let's go through it to see what it does:

font-family: This line specifies the name you want to refer to the font as. You can put this as anything you like, as long as you use it consistently throughout your CSS.
src: These lines specify the paths to the font files to be imported into your CSS (the url part), and the format of each font file (the format part). The latter part in each case is optional, but it is useful to declare it because it allows browsers to find a font they can use faster. Multiple declarations can be listed, separated by commas — the browser will search through them and use the first one it can find that it understands — it is therefore best to put newer, better formats like WOFF2 earlier on, and older, not so good formats like TTF later on. The one exception to this is the EOT fonts — they are placed first to fix a couple of bugs in older versions of IE whereby it will try to use the first thing it finds, even if it can't actually use the font.
font-weight/font-style: These lines specify what weight the font has, and whether it is italic or not. If you are importing multiple weights of the same font, you can specify what their weight/style is and then use different values of font-weight/font-style to choose between them, rather than having to call all the different members of the font family different names. @font-face tip: define font-weight and font-style to keep your CSS simple by Roger Johansson shows what to do in more detail.
Note: You can also specify particular font-variant and font-stretch values for your web fonts. In newer browsers, you can also specify a unicode-range value, which is a specific range of characters you want to use out of the web font — in supporting browsers, only the specified characters will be downloaded, saving unnecessary downloading. Creating Custom Font Stacks with Unicode-Range by Drew McLellan provides some useful ideas on how to make use of this.

Variable fonts
There is a newer font technology available in browsers called variable fonts — these are fonts that allow many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file, rather than having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style. They are somewhat advanced for our beginner's course, but if you fancy stretching yourself and looking into them, read our Variable fonts guide.
