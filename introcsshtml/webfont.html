    The CSS @font-face Rule
Web fonts allow Web designers to use fonts that are not installed on the user's computer.

When you have found/bought the font you wish to use, just include the font file on your web server, and it will be automatically downloaded to the user when needed.

Your "own" fonts are defined within the CSS @font-face rule.

Different Font Formats
TrueType Fonts (TTF)

TrueType is a font standard developed in the late 1980s, by Apple and Microsoft. TrueType is the most common font format for both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

OpenType Fonts (OTF)

OpenType is a format for scalable computer fonts. It was built on TrueType, and is a registered trademark of Microsoft. OpenType fonts are used commonly today on the major computer platforms.

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF)

WOFF is a font format for use in web pages. It was developed in 2009, and is now a W3C Recommendation. WOFF is essentially OpenType or TrueType with compression and additional metadata. The goal is to support font distribution from a server to a client over a network with bandwidth constraints.

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF 2.0)

TrueType/OpenType font that provides better compression than WOFF 1.0.

SVG Fonts/Shapes

SVG fonts allow SVG to be used as glyphs when displaying text. The SVG 1.1 specification define a font module that allows the creation of fonts within an SVG document. You can also apply CSS to SVG documents, and the @font-face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents.

Embedded OpenType Fonts (EOT)

EOT fonts are a compact form of OpenType fonts designed by Microsoft for use as embedded fonts on web pages.

Using The Font You Want
In the @font-face rule; first define a name for the font (e.g. myFirstFont) and then point to the font file.

Tip: Always use lowercase letters for the font URL. Uppercase letters can give unexpected results in IE.

To use the font for an HTML element, refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the font-family property:
CSS Font Descriptors
The following table lists all the font descriptors that can be defined inside the @font-face rule:

Descriptor	Values	Description
font-family	name	Required. Defines a name for the font
src	URL	Required. Defines the URL of the font file
font-stretch	normal
condensed

CSS @font-face Rule👪 
Definition and Usage
With the @font-face rule, web designers do not have to use one of the "web-safe" fonts anymore.

In the @font-face rule you must first define a name for the font (e.g. myFirstFont), and then point to the font file.

To use the font for an HTML element, refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the font-family property:

div {

  font-family: myFirstFont;
}
Browser Support
The @font-face rule is supported in Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.

Syntax
@font-face {
  font-properties

**********Css Tricks************
The @font-face rule allows custom fonts to be loaded on a webpage. Once added to a stylesheet, the rule instructs the browser to download the font from where it is hosted, then display it as specified in the CSS.

Without the rule, our designs are limited to the fonts that are already loaded on a user’s computer, which vary depending on the system being used. Here’s a nice breakdown of existing system fonts.

Deepest Possible Browser Support
This is the method with the deepest support possible right now. The @font-face rule should be added to the stylesheet before any styles.

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('webfont.eot'); /* IE9 Compat Modes */
  src: url('webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('webfont.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Super Modern Browsers */
       url('webfont.woff') format('woff'), /* Pretty Modern Browsers */
       url('webfont.ttf')  format('truetype'), /* Safari, Android, iOS */
       url('webfont.svg#svgFontName') format('svg'); /* Legacy iOS */
}
Then use it to style elements like this:

body {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont', Fallback, sans-serif;
}
Practical Level of Browser Support
Things are shifting heavily toward WOFF and WOFF 2, so we can probably get away with:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src:  url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
        url('myfont.woff') format('woff');
}
Slightly Deeper Browser Support
If you need a sort of a happy medium between full support and practical support, this will cover a few more bases:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('myfont.woff') format('woff'),
       url('myfont.ttf') format('truetype');
}
Super Progressive Browser Support
If we’re staking the farm on WOFF, then we can expect things to shift toward WOFF2 at some point in time. That means we can live on the bleeding edge with:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2');
}
Alternative Techniques
@import
While @font-face is excellent for fonts that are hosted on our own servers, there may be situations where a hosted font solution is better. Google Fonts offers this as a way to use their fonts. The following is an example of using @import to load the Open Sans font from Google Fonts:

@import url(//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans);
Then we can use it to style elements:

body {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
If you open the URL for the font, you can actually see all the @font-face work being done behind the scenes.

A benefit of using a hosted service is that it is likely to include all the font file variations, which ensures deep cross-browser compatibility without having to host all those files ourselves.


<link>ing a stylesheet
Similarly, you could link to the same asset as you would any other CSS file, in the of the HTML document rather than in the CSS. Using the same example from Google Fonts, this is what we would use:

Then, we can style our elements like the other methods:

body {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
Again, this is importing the @font-face rules but, instead of injecting them to our stylesheet, they are added to our HTML instead.
Understanding Font File Types
The original snippet at the top of this post references a lot of files with strange extensions. Let’s go over each one and get a better understanding of what they mean.

WOFF / WOFF2
Stands for: Web Open Font Format.

Created for use on the web, and developed by Mozilla in conjunction with other organizations, WOFF fonts often load faster than other formats because they use a compressed version of the structure used by OpenType (OTF) and TrueType (TTF) fonts. This format can also include metadata and license info within the font file. This format seems to be the winner and where all browsers are headed.

WOFF2 is the next generation of WOFF and boasts better compression than the original.

SVG / SVGZ
Stands for: Scalable Vector Graphics (Font)

SVG is a vector re-creation of the font, which makes it much lighter in file size, and also makes it ideal for mobile use. This format is the only one allowed by version 4.1 and below of Safari for iOS. SVG fonts are not currently supported by Firefox, IE or IE Mobile. Firefox has postponed implementation indefinitely to focus on WOFF.

SVGZ is the zipped version of SVG.

EOT
Stands for: Embedded Open Type.

This format was created by Microsoft (the original innovators of @font-face) and is a proprietary file standard supported only by IE. In fact, it’s the only format that IE8 and below will recognize when using @font-face.

OTF / TTF
Stands for: OpenType Font and TrueType Font.

The WOFF format was initially created as a reaction to OTF and TTF, in part, because these formats could easily (and illegally) be copied, However, OpenType has capabilities that many designers might be interested in (ligatures and such).

A Note on Performance
Web fonts are great for design but it’s important to also understand their impact on web performance. Custom fonts often cause sites to take a performance hit because the font must be downloaded before it’s displayed.

A common symptom used to be a brief moment where fonts first load as the fallback, then blink to the downloaded font. Paul Irish has an older post on this (dubbed “FOUT”: Flash Of Unstyled Text).

These days, browsers are generally hiding the text before the custom font loads by default. Better or worse? You decide. You can exert some control over this through various techniques. A little out-of-scope for this article, but here’s a trifecta of articles by Zach Leatherman to get you started down the rabbit hole:

Better @font-face with Font Load Events
How we use web fonts responsibly, or, avoiding a @font-face-palm
Flash of Faux Text—still more on Font Loading
Here are some more considerations when implementing custom fonts:

Watch the file size
Fonts can be surprisingly heavy, so lean towards options that offer lighter versions. For example, favor a font set that is 50KB versus one that weighs 400KB.

Limit the character set, if possible
Do you really need the bold and black weights for one font? Limiting your font sets to load only what is used is a good idea and there are some good tips on that here.

Consider system fonts for small screens
Many devices are stuck on crappy connections. One trick might be to target larger screens when loading the custom font using @media.

In this example, screens smaller than 1000px will be served a system font instead and screens that wide and above will be served the custom font.

@media (min-width: 1000px) { 
  body {
    font-family: 'FontName', Fallback, sans-serif; 
  }
}
Font Services
There are a number of services that will host fonts and provide access to commercially-licensed fonts as well. The benefits of using a service often boil down to having a large selection of legal fonts delivered efficiently (e.g. serving them on a speedy CDN).

Here are a few hosted font services:

Cloud Typography
Typekit
Fontdeck
Webtype
Fontspring
Typotheque
Fonts.com
Google Fonts
Font Squirrel
What About Icon Fonts?
It’s true, @font-face can load a font file full of icons that can be used for an icon system. However, I think you’re far better off using SVG as an icon system. Here’s a comparison of the two methods.

********MDN**************
n the first article of the module, we explored the basic CSS features available for styling fonts and text. In this article we will go further, exploring web fonts in detail — these allow you to download custom fonts along with your web page, to allow for more varied, custom text styling.

Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML), CSS basics (study Introduction to CSS), CSS text and font fundamentals.
Objective:	To learn how to apply web fonts to a web page, using either a third party service, or by writing your own code.
Font families recap
As we looked at in Fundamental text and font styling, the fonts applied to your HTML can be controlled using the font-family property. This takes one or more font family names, and the browser travels down the list until it finds a font it has available on the system it is running on:

p {
  font-family: Helvetica, "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;
}
This system works well, but traditionally web developers' font choices were limited. There are only a handful of fonts that you can guarantee to be available across all common systems — the so-called Web-safe fonts. You can use the font stack to specify preferable fonts, followed by web-safe alternatives, followed by the default system font, but this adds overhead in terms of testing to make sure that your designs look ok with each font, etc.

Web fonts
But there is an alternative, which works very well, right back to IE version 6. Web fonts are a CSS feature that allows you to specify font files to be downloaded along with your website as it is accessed, meaning that any browser that supports web fonts can have exactly the fonts you specify available to it. Amazing! The syntax required looks something like this:

First of all, you have a @font-face block at the start of the CSS, which specifies the font file(s) to download:

@font-face {
  font-family: "myFont";
  src: url("myFont.woff");
}
Below this you can then use the font family name specified inside @font-face to apply your custom font to anything you like, as normal:

html {
  font-family: "myFont", "Bitstream Vera Serif", serif;
}
The syntax does get a bit more complex than this; we'll go into more detail below.

There are two important things to bear in mind about web fonts:

Browsers support different font formats, so you'll need multiple font formats for decent cross-browser support. For example, most modern browsers support WOFF/WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format versions 1 and 2), the most efficient format around, but older versions of IE only support EOT (Embedded Open Type) fonts, and you might need to include an SVG version of the font to support older versions of iPhone and Android browsers. We'll show you below how to generate the required code.
Fonts generally aren't free to use. You have to pay for them, and/or follow other license conditions such as crediting the font creator in the code (or on your site). You shouldn't steal fonts and use them without giving proper credit.
Note: Web fonts as a technology have been supported in Internet Explorer since version 4!

You can use the Firefox Font Editor to investigate and manipulate the fonts in use on your page, whether they are web fonts or not. This video provides a nice walkthrough:



Active learning: A web font example
With this in mind, let's build up a basic web font example from first principles. It is difficult to demonstrate this using an embedded live example, so instead, we would like you to follow the steps detailed in the below sections, to get an idea of the process.

You should use the web-font-start.html and web-font-start.css files as a starting point to add your code to (see the live example). Make a copy of these files in a new directory on your computer now. In the web-font-start.css file, you'll find some minimal CSS to deal with the basic layout and typesetting of the example.

Finding fonts
For this example, we'll use two web fonts, one for the headings, and one for the body text. To start with, we need to find the font files that contain the fonts. Fonts are created by font foundries and are stored in different file formats. There are generally three types of sites where you can obtain fonts:

A free font distributor: This is a site that makes free fonts available for download (there may still be some license conditions, such as crediting the font creator). Examples include Font Squirrel, dafont, and Everything Fonts.
A paid font distributor: This is a site that makes fonts available for a charge, such as fonts.com or myfonts.com. You can also buy fonts directly from font foundries, for example Linotype, Monotype, or Exljbris.
An online font service: This is a site that stores and serves the fonts for you, making the whole process easier. See the Using an online font service section for more details.
Let's find some fonts! Go to Font Squirrel and choose two fonts — a nice interesting font for the headings (maybe a nice display or slab serif font), and slightly less flashy and more readable font for the paragraphs. When you find each font, press on the download button, and save the file inside the same directory as the HTML and CSS files you saved earlier. It doesn't matter whether they are TTF (True Type Fonts) or OTF (Open Type Fonts).

In each case, unzip the font package (Web fonts are usually distributed in ZIP files containing the font file(s) and licensing information). You may find multiple font files in the package — some fonts are distributed as a family with different variants available, for example thin, medium, bold, italic, thin italic, etc. For this example, we just want you to concern yourself with a single font file for each choice.

Note: Under the "Find fonts" section in the right-hand column, you can click on the different tags and classifications to filter the displayed choices.

Generating the required code
Now you'll need to generate the required code (and font formats). For each font, follow these steps:

Make sure you have satisfied any licensing requirement, if you are going to use this in a commercial and/or Web project.
Go to the Fontsquirrel Webfont Generator.
Upload your two font files using the Upload Fonts button.
Check the checkbox labeled "Yes, the fonts I'm uploading are legally eligible for web embedding."
Click Download your kit.
After the generator has finished processing, you should get a ZIP file to download — save it in the same directory as your HTML and CSS.

Web services for font generation typically limit file sizes. In such a case, consider using tools such as:

sfnt2woff-zopfli for converting ttf to woff
fontforge for converting from ttf to svg
batik ttf2svffor converting from ttf to svg
woff2for converting from ttf to woff2
Implementing the code in your demo
At this point, unzip the webfont kit you just generated. Inside the unzipped directory you'll see three useful items:

Multiple versions of each font: (for example .ttf, .woff, .woff2, etc.; the exact fonts provided will be updated over time as browser support requirements change). As mentioned above, multiple fonts are needed for cross browser support — this is Fontsquirrel's way of making sure you've got everything you need.
A demo HTML file for each font — load these in your browser to see what the font will look like in different usage contexts.
A stylesheet.css file, which contains the generated @font-face code you'll need.
To implement these fonts in your demo, follow these steps:

Rename the unzipped directory to something easy and simple, like fonts.
Open up the stylesheet.css file and copy both the @font-face blocks contained inside into your web-font-start.css file — you need to put them at the very top, before any of your CSS, as the fonts need to be imported before you can use them on your site.
Each of the url() functions points to a font file that we want to import into our CSS — we need to make sure the paths to the files are correct, so add fonts/ to the start of each path (adjust as necessary).
Now you can use these fonts in your font stacks, just like any web safe or default system font. For example:
font-family: 'zantrokeregular', serif;
You should end up with a demo page with some nice fonts implemented on them. Because different fonts are created at different sizes, you may have to adjust the size, spacing, etc., to sort out the look and feel.



Note: If you have any problems getting this to work, feel free to compare your version to our finished files — see web-font-finished.html and web-font-finished.css (run the finished example live).

Using an online font service
Online font services generally store and serve fonts for you, so you don't have to worry about writing the @font-face code, and generally just need to insert a simple line or two of code into your site to make everything work. Examples include Adobe Fonts and Cloud.typography. Most of these services are subscription-based, with the notable exception of Google Fonts, a useful free service, especially for rapid testing work and writing demos.

Most of these services are easy to use, so we won't cover them in great detail. Let's have a quick look at Google fonts, so you can get the idea. Again, use copies of web-font-start.html and web-font-start.css as your starting point.

Go to Google Fonts.
Use the filters on the left-hand side to display the kinds of fonts you want to choose and choose a couple of fonts you like.
To select a font family, press the ⊕ button alongside it.
When you've chosen the font families, press the [Number] Families Selected bar at the bottom of the page.
In the resulting screen, you first need to copy the line of HTML code shown and paste it into the head of your HTML file. Put it above the existing <link> element, so that the font is imported before you try to use it in your CSS.
You then need to copy the CSS declarations listed into your CSS as appropriate, to apply the custom fonts to your HTML.
Note: You can find a completed version at google-font.html and google-font.css, if you need to check your work against ours (see it live).

@font-face in more detail
Let's explore that @font-face syntax generated for you by fontsquirrel. This is what one of the blocks looks like:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'ciclefina';
  src: url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.eot');
  src: url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.svg#ciclefina') format('svg');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
This is referred to as "bulletproof @font-face syntax", after a post by Paul Irish from early on when @font-face started to get popular (Bulletproof @font-face Syntax). Let's go through it to see what it does:

font-family: This line specifies the name you want to refer to the font as. You can put this as anything you like, as long as you use it consistently throughout your CSS.
src: These lines specify the paths to the font files to be imported into your CSS (the url part), and the format of each font file (the format part). The latter part in each case is optional, but it is useful to declare it because it allows browsers to find a font they can use faster. Multiple declarations can be listed, separated by commas — the browser will search through them and use the first one it can find that it understands — it is therefore best to put newer, better formats like WOFF2 earlier on, and older, not so good formats like TTF later on. The one exception to this is the EOT fonts — they are placed first to fix a couple of bugs in older versions of IE whereby it will try to use the first thing it finds, even if it can't actually use the font.
font-weight/font-style: These lines specify what weight the font has, and whether it is italic or not. If you are importing multiple weights of the same font, you can specify what their weight/style is and then use different values of font-weight/font-style to choose between them, rather than having to call all the different members of the font family different names. @font-face tip: define font-weight and font-style to keep your CSS simple by Roger Johansson shows what to do in more detail.
Note: You can also specify particular font-variant and font-stretch values for your web fonts. In newer browsers, you can also specify a unicode-range value, which is a specific range of characters you want to use out of the web font — in supporting browsers, only the specified characters will be downloaded, saving unnecessary downloading. Creating Custom Font Stacks with Unicode-Range by Drew McLellan provides some useful ideas on how to make use of this.

Variable fonts
There is a newer font technology available in browsers called variable fonts — these are fonts that allow many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file, rather than having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style. They are somewhat advanced for our beginner's course, but if you fancy stretching yourself and looking into them, read our Variable fonts guide.

*******Fundamental text and font styling**********
In this article we'll start you on your journey towards mastering text styling with CSS. Here we'll go through all the basic fundamentals of text/font styling in detail, including setting font weight, family and style, font shorthand, text alignment and other effects, and line and letter spacing.

Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML), CSS basics (study Introduction to CSS).
Objective:	To learn the fundamental properties and techniques needed to style text on web pages.
What is involved in styling text in CSS?
As you'll have already experienced in your work with HTML and CSS, text inside an element is laid out inside the element's content box. It starts at the top left of the content area (or the top right, in the case of RTL language content), and flows towards the end of the line. Once it reaches the end, it goes down to the next line and continues, then the next line, until all the content has been placed in the box. Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached, or unless you force a line break manually using the <br> element.

Note: If the above paragraph leaves you feeling confused, then no matter — go back and review our Box model article, to brush up on the box model theory, before carrying on.

The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories, which we'll look at separately in this article:

Font styles: Properties that affect the font that is applied to the text, affecting what font is applied, how big it is, whether it is bold, italic, etc.
Text layout styles: Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box.
Note: Bear in mind that the text inside an element is all affected as one single entity. You can't select and style subsections of text unless you wrap them in an appropriate element (such as a <span> or <strong>), or use a text-specific pseudo-element like ::first-letter (selects the first letter of an element's text), ::first-line (selects the first line of an element's text), or ::selection (selects the text currently highlighted by the cursor.)

Fonts
Let's move straight on to look at properties for styling fonts. In this example we'll apply some different CSS properties to the same HTML sample, which looks like this:

<h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

<p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

<p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
 may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
 this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
occasion such as this that he did.</p>
You can find the finished example on GitHub (see also the source code.)

Color
The color property sets the color of the foreground content of the selected elements (which is usually the text, but can also include a couple of other things, such as an underline or overline placed on text using the text-decoration property).

color can accept any CSS color unit, for example:

p {
  color: red;
}
This will cause the paragraphs to become red, rather than the standard browser default black, like so:

To set a different font on your text, you use the font-family property — this allows you to specify a font (or list of fonts) for the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser will only apply a font if it is available on the machine the website is being accessed on; if not, it will just use a browser default font. A simple example looks like so:

p {
  font-family: arial;
}
This would make all paragraphs on a page adopt the arial font, which is found on any computer.

Web safe fonts
Speaking of font availability, there are only a certain number of fonts that are generally available across all systems and can therefore be used without much worry. These are the so-called web safe fonts.

Most of the time, as web developers we want to have more specific control over the fonts used to display our text content. The problem is to find a way to know which font is available on the computer used to see our web pages. There is no way to know this in every case, but the web safe fonts are known to be available on nearly all instances of the most used operating systems (Windows, macOS, the most common Linux distributions, Android, and iOS).

The list of actual web safe fonts will change as operating systems evolve, but it's reasonable to consider the following fonts web safe, at least for now (many of them have been popularized thanks to the Microsoft Core fonts for the Web initiative in the late 90s and early 2000s):

Name	Generic type	Notes
Arial	sans-serif	It's often considered best practice to also add Helvetica as a preferred alternative to Arial as, although their font faces are almost identical, Helvetica is considered to have a nicer shape, even if Arial is more broadly available.
Courier New	monospace	Some OSes have an alternative (possibly older) version of the Courier New font called Courier. It's considered best practice to use both with Courier New as the preferred alternative.
Georgia	serif	
Times New Roman	serif	Some OSes have an alternative (possibly older) version of the Times New Roman font called Times. It's considered best practice to use both with Times New Roman as the preferred alternative.
Trebuchet MS	sans-serif	You should be careful with using this font — it isn't widely available on mobile OSes.
Verdana	sans-serif	
Note: Among various resources, the cssfontstack.com website maintains a list of web safe fonts available on Windows and macOS operating systems, which can help you make your decision about what you consider safe for your usage.

Note: There is a way to download a custom font along with a webpage, to allow you to customize your font usage in any way you want: web fonts. This is a little bit more complex, and we will be discussing this in a separate article later on in the module.

Default fonts
CSS defines five generic names for fonts:  serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive and fantasy. Those are very generic and the exact font face used when using those generic names is up to each browser and can vary for each operating system they are running on. It represents a worst case scenario where the browser will try to do its best to provide at least a font that looks appropriate. serif, sans-serif and monospace are quite predictable and should provide something reasonable. On the other hand, cursive and fantasy are less predictable and we recommend using them very carefully, testing as you go.

The five names are defined as follows:

Term	Definition	Example
serif	Fonts that have serifs (the flourishes and other small details you see at the ends of the strokes in some typefaces)	My big red elephant
sans-serif	Fonts that don't have serifs.	My big red elephant
monospace	Fonts where every character has the same width, typically used in code listings.	My big red elephant
cursive	Fonts that are intended to emulate handwriting, with flowing, connected strokes.	My big red elephant
fantasy	Fonts that are intended to be decorative.	My big red elephant
Font stacks
Since you can't guarantee the availability of the fonts you want to use on your webpages (even a web font could fail for some reason), you can supply a font stack so that the browser has multiple fonts it can choose from. This involves a font-family value consisting of multiple font names separated by commas, e.g.

p {
  font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;
}
In such a case, the browser starts at the beginning of the list and looks to see if that font is available on the machine. If it is, it applies that font to the selected elements. If not, it moves on to the next font, and so on.

It is a good idea to provide a suitable generic font name at the end of the stack so that if none of the listed fonts are available, the browser can at least provide something approximately suitable. To emphasise this point, paragraphs are given the browser's default serif font if no other option is available — which is usually Times New Roman — this is no good for a sans-serif font!

Note: Font names that have more than one word — like Trebuchet MS — need to be surrounded by quotes, for example "Trebuchet MS".

A font-family example
Let's add to our previous example, giving the paragraphs a sans-serif font:

p {
  color: red;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
This gives us the following result:



Font size
In our previous module's CSS values and units article, we reviewed length and size units. Font size (set with the font-size property) can take values measured in most of these units (and others, such as percentages), however the most common units you'll use to size text are:

px (pixels): The number of pixels high you want the text to be. This is an absolute unit — it results in the same final computed value for the font on the page in pretty much any situation.
ems: 1 em is equal to the font size set on the parent element of the current element we are styling (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M contained inside the parent element.) This can become tricky to work out if you have a lot of nested elements with different font sizes set, but it is doable, as you'll see below. Why bother? It is quite natural once you get used to it, and you can use em to size everything, not just text. You can have an entire website sized using em, which makes maintenance easy.
rems: These work just like em, except that 1 rem is equal to the font size set on the root element of the document (i.e. <html>), not the parent element. This makes doing the maths to work out your font sizes much easier, although if you want to support really old browsers, you might struggle — rem is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below.
The font-size of an element is inherited from that element's parent element. This all starts with the root element of the entire document — <html> — the font-size of which is set to 16px as standard across browsers. Any paragraph (or another element that doesn't have a different size set by the browser) inside the root element will have a final size of 16 px. Other elements may have different default sizes, for example an <h1> element has a size of 2 em set by default, so it will have a final size of 32 px.

Things become more tricky when you start altering the font size of nested elements. For example, if you had an <article> element in your page, and set its font-size to 1.5 em (which would compute to 24 px final size), and then wanted the paragraphs inside the <article> elements to have a computed font size of 20 px, what em value would you use?

document base font-size is 16px 
<article>  If my font-size is 1.5em
    <p>My paragraph</p> How do I compute to 20px font-size? 
  </article>
  You would need to set its em value to 20/24, or 0.83333333 em. The maths can be complicated, so you need to be careful about how you style things. It is best to use rem where you can, to keep things simple, and avoid setting the font-size of container elements where possible.
  
  A simple sizing example
  When sizing your text, it is usually a good idea to set the base font-size of the document to 10 px, so that then the maths is a lot easier to work out — required (r)em values are then the pixel font size divided by 10, not 16. After doing that, you can easily size the different types of text in your document to what you want. It is a good idea to list all your font-size rulesets in a designated area in your stylesheet, so they are easy to find.
  
  Our new result is like so:
  
  html {
    font-size: 10px;
  }
  
  h1 {
    font-size: 5rem;
  }
  
  p {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    color: red;
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  }
  
  
  Font style, font weight, text transform, and text decoration
  CSS provides four common properties to alter the visual weight/emphasis of text:
  
  font-style: Used to turn italic text on and off. Possible values are as follows (you'll rarely use this, unless you want to turn some italic styling off for some reason):
  normal: Sets the text to the normal font (turns existing italics off.)
  italic: Sets the text to use the italic version of the font if available; if not available, it will simulate italics with oblique instead.
  oblique: Sets the text to use a simulated version of an italic font, created by slanting the normal version.
  font-weight: Sets how bold the text is. This has many values available in case you have many font variants available (such as -light, -normal, -bold, -extrabold, -black, etc.), but realistically you'll rarely use any of them except for normal and bold:
  normal, bold: Normal and bold font weight
  lighter, bolder: Sets the current element's boldness to be one step lighter or heavier than its parent element's boldness.
  100–900: Numeric boldness values that provide finer grained control than the above keywords, if needed. 
  text-transform: Allows you to set your font to be transformed. Values include:
  none: Prevents any transformation.
  uppercase: Transforms ALL TEXT TO CAPITALS.
  lowercase: Transforms all text to lower case.
  capitalize: Transforms all words to Have The First Letter Capitalized.
  full-width: Transforms all glyphs to be written inside a fixed-width square, similar to a monospace font, allowing aligning of e.g. Latin characters along with Asian language glyphs (like Chinese, Japanese, Korean).
  text-decoration: Sets/unsets text decorations on fonts (you'll mainly use this to unset the default underline on links when styling them.) Available values are:
  none: Unsets any text decorations already present.
  underline: Underlines the text.
  overline: Gives the text an overline.
  line-through: Puts a strikethrough over the text.
  You should note that text-decoration can accept multiple values at once, if you want to add multiple decorations simultaneously, for example text-decoration: underline overline. Also note that text-decoration is a shorthand property for text-decoration-line, text-decoration-style, and text-decoration-color. You can use combinations of these property values to create interesting effects, for example text-decoration: line-through red wavy.
  Let's look at adding a couple of these properties to our example:
  
  Our new result is like so:
  
  html {
    font-size: 10px;
  }
  
  h1 {
    font-size: 5rem;
    text-transform: capitalize;
  }
  
  h1 + p {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  
  p {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    color: red;
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  }
  
  
  Text drop shadows
  You can apply drop shadows to your text using the text-shadow property. This takes up to four values, as shown in the example below:
  
  text-shadow: 4px 4px 5px red;
  The four properties are as follows:
  
  The horizontal offset of the shadow from the original text — this can take most available CSS length and size units, but you'll most commonly use px; positive values move the shadow right, and negative values left. This value has to be included.
  The vertical offset of the shadow from the original text; behaves basically just like the horizontal offset, except that it moves the shadow up/down, not left/right. This value has to be included.
  The blur radius — a higher value means the shadow is dispersed more widely. If this value is not included, it defaults to 0, which means no blur. This can take most available CSS length and size units.
  The base color of the shadow, which can take any CSS color unit. If not included, it defaults to currentColor, i.e. the shadow’s color is taken from the element’s color property.
  Multiple shadows
  You can apply multiple shadows to the same text by including multiple shadow values separated by commas, for example:
  
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px red,
               2px 2px 1px red;
  If we applied this to the <h1> element in our Tommy the cat example, we'd end up with this:
  
  
  
  Note: You can see more interesting examples of text-shadow usage in the Sitepoint article Moonlighting with CSS text-shadow.
  
  Text layout
  With basic font properties out the way, let's now have a look at properties we can use to affect text layout.
  
  Text alignment
  The text-align property is used to control how text is aligned within its containing content box. The available values are as follows, and work in pretty much the same way as they do in a regular word processor application:
  
  left: Left-justifies the text.
  right: Right-justifies the text.
  center: Centers the text.
  justify: Makes the text spread out, varying the gaps in between the words so that all lines of text are the same width. You need to use this carefully — it can look terrible, especially when applied to a paragraph with lots of long words in it. If you are going to use this, you should also think about using something else along with it, such as hyphens, to break some of the longer words across lines.
  If we applied text-align: center; to the <h1> in our example, we'd end up with this:
  
  
  
  Line height
  The line-height property sets the height of each line of text — this can take most length and size units, but can also take a unitless value, which acts as a multiplier and is generally considered the best option — the font-size is multiplied to get the line-height. Body text generally looks nicer and is easier to read when the lines are spaced apart; the recommended line height is around 1.5 – 2 (double spaced.) So to set our lines of text to 1.6 times the height of the font, you'd use this:
  
  line-height: 1.6;
  Applying this to the <p> elements in our example would give us this result:
  
  
  
  Letter and word spacing
  The letter-spacing and word-spacing properties allow you to set the spacing between letters and words in your text. You won't use these very often, but might find a use for them to get a certain look, or to improve the legibility of a particularly dense font. They can take most length and size units.
  
  So as an example, we could apply some word- and letter-spacing to the first line of each  <p> element in our example:
  
  p::first-line {
    letter-spacing: 4px;
    word-spacing: 4px;
  }
  Let's add some to our example, like so:
  
  
  
  Other properties worth looking at
  The above properties give you an idea of how to start styling text on a webpage, but there are many more properties you could use. We just wanted to cover the most important ones here. Once you've become used to using the above, you should also explore the following:
  
  Font styles:
  
  font-variant: Switch between small caps and normal font alternatives.
  font-kerning: Switch font kerning options on and off.
  font-feature-settings: Switch various OpenType font features on and off.
  font-variant-alternates: Control the use of alternate glyphs for a given font-face.
  font-variant-caps: Control the use of alternate capital glyphs.
  font-variant-east-asian: Control the usage of alternate glyphs for East Asian scripts, like Japanese and Chinese.
  font-variant-ligatures: Control which ligatures and contextual forms are used in text.
  font-variant-numeric: Control the usage of alternate glyphs for numbers, fractions, and ordinal markers.
  font-variant-position: Control the usage of alternate glyphs of smaller sizes positioned as superscript or subscript.
  font-size-adjust: Adjust the visual size of the font independently of its actual font size.
  font-stretch: Switch between possible alternative stretched versions of a given font.
  text-underline-position: Specify the position of underlines set using the text-decoration-line property underline value.
  text-rendering: Try to perform some text rendering optimization.
  Text layout styles:
  
  text-indent: Specify how much horizontal space should be left before the beginning of the first line of the text content.
  text-overflow: Define how overflowed content that is not displayed is signaled to users.
  white-space: Define how whitespace and associated line breaks inside the element are handled.
  word-break: Specify whether to break lines within words.
  direction: Define the text direction (This depends on the language and usually it's better to let HTML handle that part as it is tied to the text content.)
  hyphens: Switch on and off hyphenation for supported languages.
  line-break: Relax or strengthen line breaking for Asian languages.
  text-align-last: Define how the last line of a block or a line, right before a forced line break, is aligned.
  text-orientation: Define the orientation of the text in a line.
  overflow-wrap: Specify whether or not the browser may break lines within words in order to prevent overflow.
  writing-mode: Define whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically and the direction in which subsequent lines flow.
  Font shorthand
  Many font properties can also be set through the shorthand property font. These are written in the following order:  font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-stretch, font-size, line-height, and font-family.
  
  Among all those properties, only font-size and font-family are required when using the font shorthand property.
  
  A forward slash has to be put in between the font-size and line-height properties.
  
  A full example would look like this:
  
  font: italic normal bold normal 3em/1.5 Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  Active learning: Playing with styling text
